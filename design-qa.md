# Design QA — Ladder Graph MVP

final result: passed

## Latest refinement — full-frame ontology graph authoring

### Evidence

- Source visual truth: `/Users/hariganesh/Desktop/Screenshot 2026-08-17 at 11.43.26 PM.png`.
- Browser implementation capture: `/tmp/ladder-graph-ontology-qa/ontology-editor-implementation.png`.
- Density-normalized implementation: `/tmp/ladder-graph-ontology-qa/ontology-editor-implementation-normalized-2556.png`.
- Full-view comparison: `/tmp/ladder-graph-ontology-qa/ontology-editor-comparison.png` (source left, implementation right).
- Source pixels: 2556 × 1327. Browser CSS viewport: 2556 × 1328 at device pixel ratio 2. The in-app Browser returned a 2252 × 1328 capture surface, which was normalized to 2556 × 1327 for the comparison.
- State: dark theme, graph view, two entity nodes, one relationship, entity inspector visible, and compiler source visible.
- A separate focused crop was unnecessary because the requested changes are macro-layout and interaction changes visible in the full-size captures. Header copy, handles, drag position, and connection results were also inspected live at 100% browser scale.

### Findings

- Passed layout and spacing: the centered 1400 px maximum, 620 px minimum canvas height, outer padding, card gap, rounded inspector, and shadow were removed. The relationship toolbar starts the workspace and the graph plus inspector fill the full frame between the application header and compiler source.
- Passed graph authoring: ontology nodes are controlled, draggable React Flow nodes. Dragged positions remain stable as labels, selections, and relationships update during the editing session.
- Passed relationship authoring: dragging a source handle to a target handle creates a portable ontology relationship, selects its inspector, renders the edge, and updates YAML with the chosen source and target type IDs.
- Passed copy: the primary ontology action reads `Save`; the canvas guidance reads `Drag nodes · connect handles to create relationships · click edges to inspect`.
- Passed typography, colors, and assets: existing Syne, Outfit, IBM Plex Mono, surface, border, cyan, graph-grid, and semantic tokens are preserved. No raster assets, inline SVGs, placeholders, or custom-drawn icons were introduced.
- Passed accessibility: the ontology title remains in the application header and accessibility tree, the relationship canvas retains its named region, and the direct manipulation help is visible without blocking pointer input.
- Passed interaction verification: added a second entity; moved the first node from approximately `(506, 651)` to `(596, 716)`; connected `entity` to `entity-2`; confirmed one rendered edge and matching YAML; selected relationship and entity inspectors; and confirmed `Save` enabled.
- Passed browser health: no console errors. Type check, production build, and all 141 unit/component tests pass.

### Comparison history

| Iteration | Finding | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Supplied before state | The fixed-height centered workspace left a large unused region below and beside the graph. | Converted the ontology preview to the workflow editor’s edge-to-edge frame and removed the duplicate visible page title. |
| Supplied before state | Nodes explicitly disabled dragging and handle connections. | Enabled controlled dragging, preserved active-session positions across React updates, and wired source-to-target handles into ontology relationship creation. |
| Supplied before state | The primary action read `Save ontology`. | Simplified ontology copy to `Save` while preserving the existing document action. |
| Final | No actionable P0, P1, or P2 issue remains in the requested layout and graph-authoring flow. | final result: passed. |

### Follow-up polish

- Manual ontology positions currently persist for the active editing session. Persisting them through a browser reload would require a deliberate portable layout extension or separate project-view metadata.

## Latest refinement — deterministic Python and TypeScript targets

### Evidence

- Source visual truth: `artifacts/qa/inspector-harness-capabilities.jpg` — the established light-theme capability inspector with Claude selected.
- Browser-rendered implementation: `artifacts/qa/code-targets-typescript-top.jpg` — the same full-stack workflow, viewport, theme, selected node, and inspector tab with TypeScript selected.
- Customization state: `artifacts/qa/code-targets-typescript.jpg` — the same implementation with the inspector scrolled to an expanded base-template customization.
- Full-view comparison input: `artifacts/qa/code-targets-comparison.jpg`.
- Focused inspector comparison input: `artifacts/qa/code-targets-focused-comparison.jpg`.
- Source and implementation pixels: 1082 × 912 at 1× density; CSS viewport: 1082 × 912. The temporary QA viewport override was reset after capture.
- State normalization: both primary captures use Full-stack app delivery, light theme, canvas view, Product and UX design selected, Capabilities active, both sidebars visible, and the first meaningful phase framed. Target-specific catalog contents and connector selections intentionally differ.

### Findings

- Passed information architecture: the existing target selector now presents Codex, Claude, Hermes Agent, Python, and TypeScript without adding a new navigation layer. The inspector consistently calls the section “Target catalog,” identifies the artifact type, and distinguishes embedded templates from external connector declarations.
- Passed capability-template model: every selected skill and connector exposes a base-template selector and editable node-specific instructions. Custom identifiers receive a safe generic base contract and can be rebased to a pre-built template. The expanded editor remains within the inspector’s established scroll model.
- Passed deterministic artifact behavior: Python and TypeScript outputs embed normalized workflow data, stable node order, dependency maps, tools, permissions, and per-node capability templates. Their readiness and capability lookup helpers are pure; generated code contains no provider imports, dynamic evaluation, connector calls, or node execution.
- Passed persistence: the Python target and customized Product design instruction survived autosave, full page reload, project reopening, Rust/WASM normalization, and a subsequent switch to TypeScript.
- Passed output actions: code targets use “Copy code” and language-specific download labels. Clipboard output preserved the selected template customization. Python and TypeScript suggested filenames and MIME types match `.ladder.py`/`text/x-python` and `.ladder.ts`/`text/typescript`.
- Passed fonts and typography: Syne, Outfit, and IBM Plex Mono roles remain unchanged. Target labels, machine identifiers, recommendations, template names, and multiline custom instructions retain the established hierarchy and readable line height.
- Passed spacing and layout rhythm: the target card, searchable catalogs, customization details, form fields, and declaration notice use the existing inspector width, 7–9 px radii, border rhythm, and compact vertical spacing. The 1082 × 912 document has no horizontal or vertical page overflow; only the inspector owns vertical scrolling.
- Passed colors and tokens: selected cyan states, graphite borders, muted descriptions, and white surfaces match the existing light system. The same state was toggled through dark mode and back with no overflow or lost content.
- Passed image quality and icon fidelity: no images, placeholders, custom SVGs, CSS drawings, or decorative substitutes were added. Existing Lucide icons remain aligned with the target selector, capability sections, and action controls.
- Passed copy and content: “Deterministic typed data module,” “Embedded capability templates,” and “no imports or network calls” communicate the new target boundary directly. The declaration notice avoids implying that generated source installs or invokes capabilities.
- Passed accessibility: target selection remains a labeled native combobox; template customization uses semantic `details`, `summary`, labeled selects, and labeled textareas; catalogs retain native pressed buttons, lists, search labels, and visible focus behavior. Meaning is not color-dependent.
- Passed generated-source verification: the browser used the Rust/WASM core for both new targets. Generated Python passed `python3 -m py_compile`; generated TypeScript passed `tsc --noEmit --target ES2020 --module ESNext`. Repeated compiler tests remained byte-identical.
- Passed browser health: Python/TypeScript selection, customization, save/reload, compile, copy, theme switching, and output closing were exercised. No browser errors or warnings were recorded.

### Comparison history

| Iteration | Finding | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Target model | The public target union, selector, persistence, and adapters only recognized Codex and Claude. | Added Hermes Agent, Python, and TypeScript end-to-end across TypeScript types, IndexedDB records, worker protocol, Rust validation, adapters, reports, and UI. |
| Template customization | Capability selections only stored IDs, so a custom capability had no reproducible base contract or node-specific behavior. | Added LGIR `customizations` records, safe generic templates, target-specific bases, editable instructions, schema coverage, and self-contained compiler output. |
| Python readability | The first data adapter embedded one escaped JSON string, which was deterministic but difficult to inspect and customize. | Replaced it with a formatted native Python data literal and recaptured the generated output; syntax validation passes. |
| State framing | The customization capture initially began mid-inspector, hiding the target context. | Captured a normalized top-of-inspector target view plus a separate focused customization state at the same viewport. |
| Final | No actionable P0, P1, or P2 issue remains in the new code-target and template-customization flow. | final result: passed. |

## Latest refinement — harness-aware skills and connectors

### Evidence

- Source visual truth: `artifacts/qa/studio-grid-aligned.jpg` — the established light-theme studio, full-stack workflow, both sidebars visible, and no selected node.
- Browser-rendered implementation: `artifacts/qa/inspector-harness-capabilities.jpg` — the same workflow and viewport with Product and UX design selected, Claude chosen, and the Capabilities tab open.
- Full-view comparison input: `artifacts/qa/inspector-harness-comparison.jpg`.
- Focused inspector comparison input: `artifacts/qa/inspector-harness-focused-comparison.jpg`.
- Source and implementation pixels: 1082 × 912 at 1× density; CSS viewport: 1082 × 912.
- State normalization: both captures use the Full-stack app delivery workflow, light theme, canvas view, first meaningful phase framing, and both sidebars. The selected-node, target, and inspector-tab differences are intentional because they expose the new configuration flow; the comparison therefore judges preservation of the studio shell plus the quality of the newly visible inspector state, not pixel equivalence between inspector contents.

### Findings

- Passed information architecture: Capabilities is a first-class inspector tab. A compact harness card establishes the selected target, repository skill location, and connector source before the editable lists.
- Passed target behavior: switching Codex, Claude, and Hermes Agent updates the visible skill path and catalog while preserving the node's declarative selections. Codex points to `.agents/skills/`; Claude points to `.claude/skills/`; Hermes points to `~/.hermes/skills/`.
- Passed selection model: searchable skill and connector catalogs provide selected, unselected, and recommended states. Selected items remain visible as removable chips, and repository-specific skill or MCP IDs can be added without being limited to the curated catalog.
- Passed layout and spacing: the 278 px inspector retains the established panel width and internal scroll behavior. Controls use the existing compact grid, border, radius, and cyan selection tokens; no persistent studio controls are clipped and the document has no horizontal overflow.
- Passed fonts and typography: the existing Syne, Outfit, and IBM Plex Mono roles are preserved. Capability labels, descriptions, identifiers, recommendations, and selected counts remain legible at the verified density, with clear hierarchy between display names and machine-readable IDs.
- Passed colors and tokens: light-mode surfaces, muted text, selected fills, focus affordances, and borders map to the existing Ladder Graph palette. The same capability state was toggled to dark mode and back without loss of contrast, content, or layout.
- Passed image quality and icon fidelity: no raster imagery, decorative substitutes, or custom-drawn SVGs were introduced. Lucide icons remain consistent with the existing toolbar and inspector icon family.
- Passed copy and content: labels distinguish skills, connectors, primitive tools, and permissions. The no-ambient-authority note explicitly states that catalog entries are suggestions rather than detected installations and that Ladder Graph never grants or invokes them.
- Passed accessibility: skills and connectors use labeled regions, semantic lists, search inputs, descriptive remove buttons, and toggle buttons with `aria-pressed`. The harness target is not communicated by color alone, and all primary controls remain keyboard-native.
- Passed compiler behavior: connector selections survive TypeScript YAML handling, Rust/WASM normalization, autosave, and compilation. Generated Codex, Claude, and Hermes Markdown declares required connectors and the target skill directory; LG201 warns that connector availability is instructional rather than executed.
- Passed browser health: target switching, selection persistence, compilation, light/dark switching, and inspector scrolling were exercised in the live app. Browser logs contain only Vite connection/HMR messages and the React development hint; no errors or application warnings were observed.

### Comparison history

| Iteration | Finding | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Capability model | Primitive tools previously carried all capability-like values, obscuring the difference between local operations and external connectors. | Added `connectors` as a first-class LGIR capability field across TypeScript, schema, Rust, diagnostics, and both target adapters. |
| Harness context | The inspector had no target-specific catalog or repository skill-location guidance. | Added a target-aware harness card and curated Codex, Claude, and Hermes skill and connector catalogs with contextual recommendations. |
| Persistence parity | The pre-existing committed WASM artifact could normalize away the newly introduced connector field. | Regenerated the committed Rust/WASM package and verified browser compilation uses the updated core. |
| Accessibility lint | Selected capability chips used generic elements with ARIA list roles. | Replaced them with native `ul`/`li` semantics and retained labeled remove controls. |
| Final | No actionable P0, P1, or P2 issue remains in the harness-aware configuration flow. | final result: passed. |

## Latest refinement — phase-aligned node grid

### Evidence

- Source visual truth: `artifacts/qa/studio-light-legible.jpg` — the browser-rendered full-stack workflow using its previous manually staggered positions.
- Browser-rendered implementation: `artifacts/qa/studio-grid-aligned.jpg`.
- Full-workflow implementation view: `artifacts/qa/studio-grid-aligned-fit-all.jpg`.
- Same-state comparison input: `artifacts/qa/studio-grid-aligned-comparison.jpg`.
- Source and implementation pixels: 1082 × 912 at 1× density; CSS viewport: 1082 × 912.
- State normalization: Full-stack app delivery, light theme, canvas mode, both sidebars visible, no selected node, first meaningful phase focused.
- The same-state comparison is sufficient for node-card, edge, typography, alignment, and spacing judgment. The fit-all capture separately verifies the complete thirteen-column workflow structure and repeated branch rows.

### Findings

- Passed graph hierarchy: dependency depth now determines a fixed column. Parallel siblings share one column, while joins, gates, approvals, and serial work return to the center row. The full-stack workflow reads as repeated fan-out → join → gate phases instead of a staggered chain.
- Passed grid alignment: node top-left positions snap to the existing 25 px canvas grid. Columns advance by 300 px and parallel rows by 200 px, using the rendered 246 × 138 px node footprint to preserve clear connection gutters.
- Passed crossing control: Dagre still supplies crossing-aware ordering. Siblings with identical predecessors and successors retain source order, keeping product/frontend/quality work above their architecture/backend/security counterparts.
- Passed initial framing: the first input, parallel design/architecture pair, and join are all fully visible between the open sidebars. A first 325 px column step left the input border fractionally clipped; reducing the step to 300 px restored complete visibility without crowding edges.
- Passed interaction: all starter workflows receive the grid layout when opened, dragged custom positions remain editable, and the toolbar action is now labeled “Align nodes to grid” for repeatable reflow.
- Passed typography and content: node type, title, summary, role, contract metadata, and edge labels are unchanged. The alignment improves scanning without reducing the established legibility scale or altering workflow meaning.
- Passed colors, icons, and imagery: node-kind colors, Lucide icons, canvas grid, edges, minimap, shadows, and light/dark tokens are unchanged. No new image assets or code-drawn substitutes were introduced.
- Passed accessibility and viewport behavior: the renamed grid action has a descriptive accessible label; the initial phase has no canvas clipping or document overflow at the verified viewport.

### Comparison history

| Iteration | Finding | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Layout engine | Template-authored positions mixed vertical and horizontal sequencing, making phases difficult to scan. | Added deterministic depth columns, centered single-node phases, fixed parallel rows, and 25 px grid snapping. |
| Semantic ordering | Crossing-aware ordering could reverse equivalent product/architecture sibling pairs. | Preserve document order when siblings have identical predecessor and successor sets; retain Dagre ordering for structurally different nodes. |
| Initial framing | A 325 px phase step left the input node border fractionally outside the canvas when both sidebars were visible. | Reduced the phase step to 300 px and recaptured the same viewport; input through join are fully visible. |
| Final | No actionable P0, P1, or P2 issue remains in the requested node-layout refinement. | final result: passed. |

## Latest refinement — viewport-fit gallery and category tabs

### Evidence

- Source visual truth: `artifacts/qa/welcome-light-legible.jpg` — the browser-rendered stacked-category gallery before this refinement.
- Browser-rendered implementation: `artifacts/qa/welcome-tabs-scroll.jpg`.
- Full-view comparison input: `artifacts/qa/welcome-tabs-scroll-comparison.jpg`.
- Source and implementation pixels: 1082 × 912 at 1× density; CSS viewport: 1082 × 912.
- State normalization: welcome gallery, light theme, Core patterns selected, scrolled to the top, identical saved-browser data.
- A focused crop was unnecessary because the title, actions, complete tab row, active state, category description, workflow card, internal-scroll boundary, saved-project continuation, and footer are readable in the same full-view comparison.

### Findings

- Passed information architecture: seven stacked workflow groups are replaced by one semantic tablist and one selected category panel. The selected category controls the visible workflow cards without changing their content or primary action.
- Passed viewport fit: `.welcome-shell` is a three-row 100dvh grid. The brand header, gallery controls, and product footer remain visible while `.workflow-tab-panel` owns vertical overflow. The document height equals the 912 px viewport and has no horizontal overflow.
- Passed spacing and layout rhythm: the title area is more compact, the tab row fits the verified desktop width without horizontal scrolling, and the selected category uses a three-column card grid. At narrower breakpoints the tab row becomes horizontally scrollable and the card grid falls to two and then one column.
- Passed typography: the existing Syne, Outfit, and IBM Plex Mono hierarchy and the previous legibility scale are unchanged. Tab labels use 12 px semibold text with non-wrapping labels and readable active contrast.
- Passed color tokens: active, hover, border, and surface states are defined in both light and dark themes. Dark-mode verification retained the cyan selected state without document overflow.
- Passed image and icon fidelity: no new raster imagery or custom-drawn assets were introduced. Existing Lucide area icons are reused in the tab and selected-category heading.
- Passed copy and content: category names, descriptions, workflow metadata, card descriptions, and actions are unchanged; the new structure removes repeated category content from the initial viewport.
- Passed interaction and accessibility: tabs expose `tablist`, `tab`, `tabpanel`, `aria-selected`, `aria-controls`, and roving tabindex semantics. Click, Left/Right Arrow, Home, and End navigation update both focus and selected content.
- Passed browser health: Core patterns, Software engineering, and keyboard navigation to Product management were exercised. Light/dark switching works, the exact viewport has no document overflow, and no current-origin error or warning logs were observed.

### Comparison history

| Iteration | Finding | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Information architecture | Stacked categories made the gallery much taller than the browser and repeated category headings down the page. | Replaced the stack with a compact category tablist and a single selected panel. |
| Viewport fit | Letting the document own scrolling moved global navigation and product context out of view. | Converted the gallery to a 100dvh shell and moved overflow to the workflow result panel while retaining the header and footer. |
| Interaction QA | Category selection needed to work beyond pointer input. | Added semantic tabs with roving tabindex and Arrow, Home, and End keyboard navigation. |
| Final | No actionable P0, P1, or P2 issue remains in the requested page-fit and tab refinement. | final result: passed. |

## Latest refinement — legible type and light mode

### Evidence

- Compact typography baseline: `artifacts/qa/welcome-library.png`.
- Browser-rendered light gallery: `artifacts/qa/welcome-light-legible.jpg`.
- Gallery before/after comparison: `artifacts/qa/welcome-light-comparison.jpg`.
- Exact-state studio captures: `artifacts/qa/studio-dark-legible.jpg` and `artifacts/qa/studio-light-legible.jpg`.
- Exact-state studio theme comparison: `artifacts/qa/studio-light-comparison.jpg`.
- Gallery and studio implementation captures use a 1082 × 912 CSS viewport at 1× density. The full-stack workflow, selected target, graph framing, panels, and scroll position are identical in the exact-state studio comparison; only the theme changes.
- The focused region is visible in the full-view studio comparison: palette copy, graph node titles and descriptions, toolbar controls, inspector copy, edge labels, and status text remain judgeable without a crop.

### Findings

- Passed typography: the effective UI floor moved from 7–9 px in the densest regions to 10 px for metadata, 11–14 px for controls and supporting copy, 15 px for graph node titles, and 13 px in the source editor. Larger controls and wider panels prevent the increased text scale from introducing clipping.
- Passed spacing: the header, status bar, library, inspector, cards, inputs, and graph nodes were resized with the type rather than relying on tighter wrapping. Neither the gallery nor studio has horizontal document overflow at the verified viewport.
- Passed light tokens: Ladder Graph now defaults to a warm, low-glare light theme with white working surfaces, graphite text, stronger borders, readable muted text, and adapted graph grid, edges, minimap, diagnostics, CodeMirror, drawers, and modal surfaces.
- Passed dark-theme parity: the established dark technical palette remains available. The gallery and compact studio theme controls switch modes without changing graph state or layout.
- Passed persistence: changing the theme updates the document immediately, persists through reload, and returns to the saved choice without a flash of the wrong default theme.
- Passed accessibility: both theme controls have state-specific accessible labels, diagnostic meaning remains non-color-dependent, existing visible keyboard focus styles are retained, and reduced-motion behavior is unchanged.
- Passed browser health: the full-stack template opened as valid, both studio themes rendered at the same viewport with no overflow, and no current-origin console errors were observed.

### Comparison history

| Iteration | Finding | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Legibility audit | Dense metadata and graph copy dropped below a comfortable reading size. | Raised the typographic floor across gallery, studio, graph nodes, inspector, drawers, forms, diagnostics, and source editor; resized their containers in tandem. |
| Theme pass | The established product styling only provided a dark working environment. | Added a complete light token system, made light the first-use default, and retained dark mode through persistent gallery and studio toggles. |
| Exact-state QA | A first comparison used different graphs and viewport proportions, weakening visual judgment. | Recaptured the same full-stack graph at 1082 × 912 in both themes and compared those browser renders side by side. |
| Final | No actionable P0, P1, or P2 issue remains in the requested legibility and light-mode refinement. | Final result: passed. |

## Latest gallery refinement — grouped workflow library

### Evidence

- Source visual truth: `artifacts/qa/welcome.png` — the previous Ladder Graph gallery and its established visual system.
- Browser-rendered implementation: `artifacts/qa/welcome-library.png`.
- Combined comparison input: `artifacts/qa/welcome-library-comparison.png`.
- Source pixels: 1280 × 720 at 1× density.
- Implementation pixels and CSS viewport: 1082 × 912 at 1× density.
- Comparison normalization: both captures were fitted without cropping into a shared 1270 × 720 comparison canvas. The viewport difference is recorded because the requested information architecture intentionally replaces the previous hero rather than reproducing its geometry.
- State: welcome gallery, scrolled to the top, no saved-project section visible.
- Focused region comparison was unnecessary: the changed header, primary action, group labels, first template card, typography, spacing, colors, icons, and copy are all legible in the full-view comparison.

### Findings

- Passed typography: Syne remains the display face, Outfit remains the interface face, and IBM Plex Mono remains reserved for compact workflow metadata. The new title is visually dominant without the removed marketing headline competing with it.
- Passed spacing and layout rhythm: “Starter workflows” and “New workflow” form one clear top row; discipline labels create a stable left rail; workflow cards use a denser two-column library grid. Mobile rules stack the heading/action and collapse cards to one column.
- Passed colors and tokens: the existing near-black field, graphite borders, muted copy, and discipline accents are unchanged.
- Passed image and icon fidelity: no raster imagery was introduced. Existing Lucide icon treatment is reused consistently for the brand, area labels, cards, and actions.
- Passed copy and content: “Draw the shape of work,” “Compile it to a prompt,” the promise cards, and numeric starter-workflow language are removed. The page now uses the requested “Starter workflows” and “New workflow” labels.
- Passed interaction: New workflow opens a blank studio; UX audit + redesign brief opens the populated studio; both return to the gallery correctly.
- Passed browser health: no current-origin console errors and no horizontal overflow at the verified desktop viewport.

### Comparison history

| Iteration | Finding | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gallery refinement | The previous marketing hero delayed access to workflows and the library was not organized by discipline. | Removed the hero and promise cards, promoted the library heading and new-workflow action, and grouped the expanded templates by professional area. |
| Responsive polish | The heading and action could compete for width on a narrow screen. | Stack the library heading and New workflow action below 620 px; cards collapse to one column. |
| Final | No actionable P0, P1, or P2 mismatch remains in the requested gallery refinement. | Final result: passed. |

## Visual source of truth

- Welcome: `/tmp/ladder-graph-audit/01-welcome.jpg`
- Studio: `/tmp/ladder-graph-audit/02-studio.jpg`
- Compiler drawer: `/tmp/ladder-graph-audit/03-compile.jpg`
- Inspector: `/tmp/ladder-graph-audit/04-node-inspector.jpg`

The source is the read-only CODEZ concept supplied with the repository. Ladder Graph intentionally preserves its dark technical visual system, density, canvas grammar, minimap, inspector, and compiler drawer while replacing runtime claims and branding with the approved compiler-only product.

## Implementation captures

- Welcome: `artifacts/qa/welcome.png`
- Studio: `artifacts/qa/studio-final.png`
- Compiler drawer: `artifacts/qa/compile.png`
- Mobile welcome: `artifacts/qa/mobile.png`
- Mobile studio: `artifacts/qa/mobile-studio-final.png`

Reference and implementation were captured at the same 1280 × 720 viewport. Combined comparison inputs:

- `artifacts/qa/welcome-comparison.png`
- `artifacts/qa/studio-comparison.png`
- `artifacts/qa/compile-comparison.png`

No focused crop was needed: layout, hierarchy, density, typography, graph framing, panels, and drawer behavior were all judgeable from full-viewport comparisons.

## Comparison findings

### Welcome

- Passed: header placement, oversized two-line hero, muted second line, dark atmospheric field, compact uppercase eyebrow, three promise cards, and gallery transition preserve the source language.
- Intentional change: runtime-oriented copy, six topology cards, and CODEZ branding are replaced by compiler positioning, three outcome-led workflows, and Ladder Graph branding.
- Intentional change: the product promise occupies slightly more vertical space to keep security and validation copy readable; the gallery remains directly below the first viewport.

### Studio

- Passed: header density, three-panel composition, grid canvas, colored contract nodes, curved relationships, controls, minimap, inspector, and compact status bar match the source grammar.
- Intentional change: initial framing focuses the first meaningful four-node phase at readable scale. The original source shrinks a fourteen-node graph to thumbnails; fit-all remains available through the canvas control.
- Fixed during QA: the first node was clipped when both desktop panels were visible. Initial fit now targets the meaningful phase and shows input, draft, critique, and revision fully.

### Compiler drawer

- Passed: bottom sheet hierarchy, capability rail, target badge, copy/download actions, monospaced artifact preview, and retained canvas context match the source structure.
- Intentional change: JavaScript tabs and runtime output are replaced with one target Markdown artifact plus native/instructional capability reporting.

### Responsive and accessibility

- Passed at 390 × 844 with no horizontal document overflow.
- Fixed during QA: palette and inspector initially opened together over the narrow canvas. Narrow layouts now open on the graph; library and inspector are accessible from separate header controls and close each other when switched.
- Passed semantic checks: document language and title present, zero unlabeled buttons, no horizontal overflow at desktop or mobile, visible 2 px cyan keyboard focus with 2 px offset, and no browser console warnings or errors.
- Reduced-motion CSS disables animated graph edges and collapses transitions.

## Functional journey verified

1. Opened Draft → critique → revise.
2. Selected the structured loop and edited its maximum iterations to zero.
3. Observed diagnostic `LG120`, node highlighting, and the instructional target note.
4. Applied “Set a safe three-iteration bound” and returned to a valid graph.
5. Compiled Codex Markdown, copied it, and verified clipboard frontmatter.
6. Switched to Claude and verified target metadata and Claude capability reporting.
7. Confirmed graph and CodeMirror are both visible in split mode.
8. Confirmed mobile panel switching and desktop 1280 × 720 layout.

## QA history

| Iteration | Finding | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Desktop fit-all clipped the first node at the enforced readable zoom. | Initial fit targets the first meaningful phase; fit-all stays secondary. |
| 2 | Narrow studio showed palette and inspector simultaneously. | Default both closed below 880 px; mobile toggles are mutually exclusive. |
| 3 | CSS nth-of-type rule hid the library toggle on mobile. | Replaced positional selectors with explicit secondary-action classes. |
| Final | Full journey, comparisons, responsive behavior, focus, labels, overflow, and console health passed. | Final result: passed. |
