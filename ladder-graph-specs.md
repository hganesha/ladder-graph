# Ladder Graph MVP Specification

Status: implemented MVP baseline
Product surface: offline-first visual compiler
LGIR version: `ladder.dev/v1alpha1`

## Product outcome

Ladder Graph helps developers design agent workflows visually, validate the hard parts, and compile one self-contained artifact for Codex, Claude, Hermes Agent, Python, or TypeScript.

The MVP is a compiler, not an agent runtime. It never calls a model, executes a shell command, invokes MCP, stores provider credentials, or claims that an instructional target feature is mechanically enforced.

### Primary user journey

Within ten minutes, a developer can:

1. Open an outcome-led template.
2. Edit a role or prompt in the inspector.
3. Inspect the synchronized LGIR YAML.
4. Identify an unbounded loop diagnostic.
5. Apply the safe bounded-loop repair.
6. Select an instructional harness or deterministic code target.
7. Validate and compile.
8. Copy or download the generated artifact.

Activation occurs when a user validates and copies or downloads a workflow with at least three agent or control nodes.

## Scope

### Included

- Visual and YAML authoring of deterministic workflows.
- Dependencies, typed data edges, control edges, parallel branches, joins, aggregators, conditions, evaluations, teacher-model feedback, approvals, structured loops, execution groups, and subgraphs.
- Canonical node kinds: `input`, `output`, `agent`, `tool`, `transform`, `condition`, `evaluate`, `teacher`, `approval`, `join`, `aggregator`, `loop`, `group`, and `subgraph`.
- Declarative transforms: select, rename, merge, filter, deduplicate, sort, and slice.
- Visual macro insertion for Parallel, Pipeline, Reduce, and Verify. Macros materialize canonical nodes and edges before validation.
- Role templates for the eight core roles plus 20 software-development, 20 security, and 20 architecture/design specialists. Research-derived roles preserve their narrow responsibility, handoff, verification, connector, and authorization boundaries.
- Deterministic Codex, Claude, and Hermes Agent Markdown adapters.
- Deterministic Python and TypeScript data-module adapters with stable node order, dependencies, capability manifests, and pure readiness helpers.
- IndexedDB projects and indexes, OPFS revision bodies with IndexedDB fallback, autosave, explicit import/export, and PWA offline support.

### Excluded

- Model, agent, tool, MCP, shell, Python, or JavaScript execution.
- Provider accounts, credentials, traces, cost tracking, telemetry, cloud sync, or collaboration.
- Arbitrary code transforms, generated executors with side effects, native multi-file packs, or round-trip parsing of target files.

## Experience requirements

The welcome screen groups outcome-led starter workflows by area, including these core shapes:

- Draft → critique → bounded revision.
- Parallel implementation and risk review → join.
- Evidence research → synthesis → evaluation.

The expanded library also includes secure software delivery, security incident response, multimodal asset production, image-to-text extraction, reference-image transformation, and coordinated building design. Input nodes can declare text, image, audio, video, document, or bounded mixed-media JSON Schema contracts. Media stays a host-provided reference—Ladder Graph records the contract and compiles instructions but never uploads, fetches, or executes against the asset. These templates add explicit cost, authorization, professional-review, containment, publication, and release approvals where the underlying work can affect external systems, people, or budgets.

The studio retains the reference concept’s dark technical language: compact navigation, grid canvas, colored graph cards, minimap, palette, inspector, and bottom compiler drawer. All visible branding is Ladder Graph and all copy describes compilation rather than execution.

The canvas focuses the meaningful phase rather than shrinking the entire graph to a thumbnail. The palette is searchable and categorized. Side panels collapse. Canvas, split, and YAML modes are available. Diagnostics identify a stable code, source path, node or edge, severity, explanation, target capability, and safe repair where possible.

The primary journey must meet WCAG 2.2 AA: keyboard-reachable controls, visible focus, non-color severity indicators, reduced motion, adequate label contrast, semantic alternatives, and readable behavior at 200% zoom.

## LGIR v1alpha1

YAML is canonical. Every document starts with:

```yaml
apiVersion: ladder.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  name: lowercase-slug
spec:
  objective: A verifiable outcome.
  nodes: []
  edges: []
```

Rust structs are the semantic authority. The checked-in JSON Schema at `public/schema/lgir-v1alpha1.schema.json` is the portable authoring contract; TypeScript types mirror the worker result boundary.

### Target capabilities

Agent, evaluator, and tool nodes declare four separate capability sets: `skills`, primitive `tools`, `connectors`, and `permissions`. The studio changes its suggested catalog with the selected Codex, Claude, Hermes Agent, Python, or TypeScript target, highlights recommendations inferred from the node role, and preserves custom identifiers.

Every selected skill or connector resolves to a `customizations` record containing a pre-built base `template` and editable `instructions`. Custom identifiers start from a safe generic skill or connector contract and can be rebased onto another available template. The complete template selection and customization is stored in LGIR, so generated artifacts are reproducible and do not depend on hidden studio state.

Agent, evaluator, teacher, and tool nodes may declare an optional host-resolved `workingDirectory`. An empty value inherits the workflow host's default folder. Ladder Graph preserves this path in LGIR and compiled instructions but does not enumerate, open, validate, or grant access to the directory.

Catalog entries are authoring suggestions, not an inventory of installed capabilities. Ladder Graph does not connect to a harness, inspect user configuration, install skills, grant permissions, import runtime packages, or invoke connectors. Compiled Markdown names every required skill and connector and embeds custom instructions. Generated code exposes the same declarations as inert data for an explicitly supplied host application. OpenRouter profiles are research snapshots: model slugs, endpoints, supported parameters, asynchronous behavior, availability, and pricing must be verified before use, and credentials must never be stored in LGIR.

The bundled research library includes mathematics, music, and physics specialists and starter workflows. Symbolic solvers, recommendation systems, audio-analysis tools, scientific databases, simulation packages, and notation or DAW integrations remain declarative requirements; generated workflows must report uncertainty and cannot imply that an unavailable tool performed a calculation, transcription, simulation, or measurement.

### Structured loops

A loop owns a body list, an exit-condition reference, `maxIterations` from 1 through 100, and an exhaustion policy. Back-edges and self-edges are invalid. Targets render loops as explicit bounded instructions and report the capability as instructional.

### Aggregators and teacher models

An aggregator combines multiple upstream outputs using one explicit strategy: `collect` creates source-tagged entries, `merge` combines object fields while surfacing collisions, `concat` preserves array order, and `vote` tallies identical scalar or category values while preserving ties. A join only waits and releases branch outputs; it does not aggregate them.

A teacher node requests feedback from a host-resolved `teacherModel` in `critique`, `score`, or `rubric` mode. It requires a prompt and emits a declared feedback contract. Ladder Graph records and compiles the model reference but never contacts the model provider or stores provider credentials.

### Execution groups

A group is a visible bounding container with one external input and one external output. It owns an ordered `members` list, runs those members in `sequential` or `parallel` mode, and exits only after every member result has been `aggregate`d or `serialize`d. Direct edges across a member boundary produce diagnostics so inputs enter through the group and outputs leave through its collector.

### Security limits

- Imports are capped at 2 MB and 1,000 nodes.
- Custom YAML tags, anchors, aliases, and external references are rejected.
- Duplicate IDs, missing endpoints, unsupported node kinds, and arbitrary cycles are errors.
- Imported content is never executed.
- Generated Markdown and source code are rendered as text, not injected HTML or executed in the browser.

## Compiler interfaces

The browser calls a dedicated Web Worker. The worker loads the committed Rust-generated WebAssembly module and falls back to the TypeScript parity implementation only when WebAssembly initialization is unavailable.

```ts
type Target = "codex" | "claude" | "hermes" | "python" | "typescript"
analyze(yaml: string, target?: Target): AnalysisResult
format(yaml: string): FormatResult
compile(yaml: string, target: Target): CompileResult
migrate(yaml: string, toVersion: string): MigrationResult
```

Compilation is blocked by errors. Results contain one artifact, filename, MIME type, source hash, compiler and adapter versions, diagnostics, and a capability report with `native`, `instructional`, and `unsupported` states. Unsupported target constructs are never omitted silently.

Codex artifacts include Agent Skills-compatible frontmatter and can be saved beneath `.agents/skills/`; repository-wide instructions remain `AGENTS.md`. Claude artifacts use equivalent `SKILL.md` content and can be saved beneath `.claude/skills/`. Hermes artifacts add `metadata.hermes` fields and can be saved as `~/.hermes/skills/ladder-graph/<workflow>/SKILL.md`. Hermes toolsets, MCP servers, and OpenRouter profiles remain explicit capability requirements: Ladder Graph neither edits `~/.hermes/config.yaml` nor stores provider credentials. Every file declares its target and documentation date. See the official [Hermes skills](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/main/website/docs/user-guide/features/skills.md), [tools and toolsets](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/main/website/docs/user-guide/features/tools.md), and [MCP integration](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/main/website/docs/guides/use-mcp-with-hermes.md) documentation.

Python artifacts are importable `.ladder.py` modules. TypeScript artifacts are typed `.ladder.ts` modules. Both embed the normalized workflow, stable topological order, dependency map, and per-node capability-template manifest, plus pure `ready_nodes`/`readyNodes` and capability lookup helpers. They do not import providers, invoke connectors, evaluate expressions, or execute nodes.

## Architecture decisions

- React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind 4, React Flow, CodeMirror 6, Zustand, and Dagre.
- Rust owns parsing, normalization, semantic validation, stable diagnostics, hashing, and target compilation.
- The UI owns browser I/O, graph interaction, layout, YAML CST patching, download/copy, and persistence.
- Generated WebAssembly artifacts are committed after stripping non-semantic custom sections so macOS and Linux builds remain byte-reproducible. Static hosts only run the Node/Vite build.
- The PWA precaches its shell, fonts, templates, schema, worker, and WebAssembly and has no runtime CDN dependency.

## Product success and GTM

The launch story is a 90-second draft–critique–revise demo, inspectable graphs, a graph-versus-generated-artifact comparison, and an explicit no-account/no-runtime security statement. Distribution focuses on GitHub, Hacker News, coding-agent communities, applied-AI researchers, and template contributors.

Moderated validation succeeds when at least four of five participants can explain execution order, repair an unsafe loop, understand a target warning, and produce a usable prompt within ten minutes. With telemetry excluded, adoption is assessed through moderated studies, repository activity, discussions, issues, and opt-in feedback.

## Release criteria

A release requires formatting, type checking, Rust tests, checked-in WebAssembly reproducibility, unit tests, production build, three-browser journey coverage, offline verification, accessibility checks, malformed-input coverage, and deterministic target fixtures. The 200-node fixture must remain interactive and analyze/compile within 250 ms on the CI baseline; the 1,000-node limit is view-only.
